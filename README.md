# The Task Manager App on React

The App allows everyone to see, sort, and create tasks without registration. 

A user can preview a task before posting it. Also, a user can upload JPG/GIF/PNG images to the task. If he uploads an image more than 320Ñ…240 pixels, an image will be resized proportionally.

An admin can edit any task in the app.
